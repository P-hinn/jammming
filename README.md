## Jammming
Jamming is a React app that works with the Spotify API.
When the page is visited for the first time, the consent of the connection to Spotify must be accepted.
Using the app, songs can be searched for and played with Spotify.
You can create a new playlist, give it a name, assign songs to it and save this playlist in your Spotify account.

## Bugs
If you have not used the Spotify app for a while, the songs cannot be started from the app. 
This is probably due to the fact that the Spotify API does not contain a current player that the app tries to access.
